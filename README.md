# Mini-Project-Supply-Chain-Management-
This project involves the development of an end-to-end Power BI dashboard using a cleaned supply chain dataset consisting of order-level information from two countriesâ€”India and the United States. The dashboard is structured into four key pages: Executive Dashboard, Map Dashboard, Product Detail Dashboard, and Customer Detail Dashboard. Each page presents unique business insights through visualizations such as KPI cards, line charts, bar graphs, pie charts, and geo-maps. A comprehensive set of 15+ DAX measures has been created to capture critical metrics including Total Sales, Profit, Profit Margin, On-Time Delivery Rate, Product Rankings, and more. Visual-level filters and Top-N logic were applied using both built-in Power BI filters and dynamic DAX formulas to enhance interactivity and analytical depth. This project is designed to support supply chain performance monitoring, product and customer analysis, and strategic decision-making.
